## Features

The repository focuses on Javascript code to build the function and logic for the quiz, and includes the following features:

### General

* Semantic elements for use of accessibility.
* HTML IDs that connect to CSS and Javascript functions and elements.
* Media query and flexboxes for various resolution and devices.
* Guided comments for navigation of HTML, CSS, and Javascript structure.
* Use of Bootstrap features, including a navbar and container.

### Javascript-specific

* Variables that store questions, reference HTML IDs, and establish parameters.
* Appends IDs and elements on the HTML page, and removes/add classes.
* References the array of questions and publishes it to the page.
* Integrates a timer as the primary mode of recording a score.

* Code will prompt user to try again if input does not match established parameters.
* Selectable criterion for inclusion in string generation.
* Personality, because machines should unionize as well.
* Gives audio and written feedback for correct and incorrect answers.
